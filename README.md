# WTF_App
WTF is a "ground-breaking" app that lets users search for where to eat, where to drink and what is going in Nashville for any date they are visiting. Basically, it just lets a user figure out WTF is going on in Nashville.

Simply select the date you are visiting on the datepicker calendar and ouila!

WTF utilizes the Yelp Fusion API and the TicketMaster API, AJAX, Bootstrap, Materialize, Animate.css and Firebase.
